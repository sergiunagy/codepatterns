/**
 * The data structure describing a single signal.
 *   Objects of this class are part of the nested data structure passed to the template
 * engine for rendering the information in the wanted format.<p>
 *   The basic design principle is the use of public members because such members can be
 * directly accessed from the output templates. Boolean decisions are either expressed as
 * explicit public Boolean members or by references to nested member objects, which are
 * null if an optional member is not used or applicable: StringTemplate can query public
 * Boolean members or check for null references. Convenience functions, which permit to
 * query information that can easily and on the fly be derived from the other public
 * members is implemented as Getter.

    /** Query function for special signals: Is this signal a particular special signal?<p>
          The field is a Java Map object if the signal has been recognized as a special
        signal, otherwise <b>is</b> is null. (Special signals -- e.g. a checksum or a
        sequence counter -- and how to recognize them is user-specified by according
        command line arguments.) The unusual name of this member has been chosen for sake
        of an intuitive design of the aimed template code, see below.<p>
          The map has a single key, value pair for each special signal it matches with
        (normally only one). The key is the symbolic name of the special signal as it
        has been specified on the command line and the value is a Boolean {@code true}.
        Using a Map object in StringTemplate implicitly leads to a Boolean {@code false} if
        a key is used, which is not stored in the map. Consequently, if asking for the
        name of a special signal you will always get the correct answer whether the signal
        is or is not this special signal.<p>
          Example: Be {@code --special-signal-name checksum --re-special-signal crc.*} part
        of the command line. A signal, whose name matches the regular expression {@code
        crc.*} is recognized as special signal {@code checksum} and a StringTemplate V4
        template could use a construct as follows to emit specific code for those checksum
        signals:
        <pre>{@code
          <pdu.signalAry:{s|<if(s.is.checksum)><\\>
          printf("The checksum of PDU " <pdu> " is %u\n", <cif_signalVarName(s)>);
