/**
 * The data structure describing a communication node in the bus.
 *   An object of this class contains the results of parsing a single DBC input file. The
 * object is part of the nested data structure passed to the template engine for rendering
 * the information in the wanted format.<p>
 *   The basic design principle is the use of public members because such members can be
 * directly accessed from the output templates. Boolean decisions are either expressed as
 * explicit public Boolean members or by references to nested member objects, which are
 * null if an optional member is not used or applicable: StringTemplate can query public
 * Boolean members or check for null references.
