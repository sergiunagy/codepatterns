/**
 * The data structure describing an attribute value definition.
 *   Objects of this class are part of the nested data structure passed to the template
 * engine for rendering the information in the wanted format.<p>
 *   The basic design principle is the use of public members because such members can be
 * directly accessed from the output templates. Boolean decisions are either expressed as
 * explicit public Boolean members or by references to nested member objects, which are
 * null if an optional member is not used or applicable: StringTemplate can query public
 * Boolean members or check for null references. Convenience functions, which permit to
 * query information that can easily and on the fly be derived from the other public
 * members is implemented as Getter.

        the network database. Although this order is meaningless the index can be used to
        support the implementation of arrays of objects or enumerations by a list of

          The numeric value for an enumeration attribute is its 0 based index, where the
        index relates to the list of value names specified in the attribute definition.
          @remark The full value range of Java's Long is not supported for attributes of
        type int and hex. This Java type has been chosen to safely capture the intended
        range of unsigned 32 Bit integers. Attribute value handling involves floating point
        operations and (far) outside the 32 Bit integer range there might be numeric
        deviations because of the limited resolution of type double. */

        have the attribute's default value (but it can't have no value). Whether this

    public boolean isDefVal = false;
    
    /** Query function for enumeration type attributes: Does the attribute have a specific
        enumeration value?<p>
          The query is implemented as a Java Map if the attribute is of type enumeration,
        otherwise <b>is</b> is null. The unusual name of this member has been chosen for
        sake of an intuitive design of the aimed template code.<p>
          The map has a single key, value pair. The key is the name of the value the
        enumeration attribute has and the value is a Boolean true. Using a map object in
        StringTemplate implicitly leads to a Boolean false if a key is used, which is not
        stored in the map. Consequently, just asking for an enumeration value name you will
        always get the correct answer whether the attribute has this value.<p>
          Example: Given, the attribute definition specifies an enumeration for the send
        characteristics of a frame with the possible values "undefined", "regular",
        "occasional", then your StringTemplate V4 template could look like:
        <pre>{@code 
          <if(frame.attribMap.sendCharacteristics.is.regular)>
            // <frame.name> is a regularly sent frame.
            // ... Put your C code generation to handle regular frames here
          <elseif(frame.attribMap.sendCharacteristics.is.occasional)>
            // <frame.name> is an event triggered frame.
            // ... Put your C code generation to handle event triggered frames here
          <else>
            #error Unexpected type of frame found for <frame.name>. Please, double <\\>
            check your network database file <bus.networkFile>
          <endif>}
        </pre> */
