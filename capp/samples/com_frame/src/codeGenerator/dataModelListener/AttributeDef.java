/**
 * The data structure describing an attribute definition.
 *   Objects of this class are part of the nested data structure passed to the template
 * engine for rendering the information in the wanted format.<p>
 *   The basic design principle is the use of public members because such members can be
 * directly accessed from the output templates. Boolean decisions are either expressed as
 * explicit public Boolean members or by references to nested member objects, which are
 * null if an optional member is not used or applicable: StringTemplate can query public
 * Boolean members or check for null references. Convenience functions, which permit to
 * query information that can easily and on the fly be derived from the other public
 * members is implemented as Getter.
