             A bug of the Kvaser Database Editor (Version 3.13.317, Sep 9, 2020) disclosed
           a bug in our DBC parser: The Kvaser editor had written bad attribute lines, like
           this:
             BA_ "GenSigStartValue" BO_ 1793 100;
           although the attribute GenSigStartValue had been properly defined as signal
           related. For another signal from the same message it had correctly written:
             BA_ "GenSigStartValue" SG_ 1793 ALIV 100;
           In the code below, our parser goes into the switch statement and selects the
           case not because of what had actually been parsed but because of its already
           available knowledge about the attribute: The BA_DEF_ statement has been parsed
           and it had declared "GenSigStartValue" to be a signal related attribute and now
           it goes into the "case signal". However, the ANTLR parse result doesn't contain
           the fields, which are normally set for a signal attribute.
             The same can happen for all cases. We need to inspect all variable grammar
           rule elements before use. These are: nodeName, msgId, signalName and envVarName. */
