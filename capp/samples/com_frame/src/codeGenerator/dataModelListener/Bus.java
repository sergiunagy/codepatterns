/**
 * The data structure describing a communication bus in the cluster.
 *   An object of this class contains the results of parsing a single DBC input file. The
 * object is part of the nested data structure passed to the template engine for rendering
 * the information in the wanted format.<p>
 *   The basic design principle is the use of public members because such members can be
 * directly accessed from the output templates. Boolean decisions are either expressed as
 * explicit public Boolean members or by references to nested member objects, which are
 * null if an optional member is not used or applicable: StringTemplate can query public
 * Boolean members or check for null references.

        StringTemplate V4 template expression like {@code <bus.sortFrameAry.byId>}, where
        {@code byId} is meant an example of a supported sort order. All subsequently
        evaluated template expressions will find the field {@code <bus.frameAry>} in the
        new sort order. Supported sort orders are:<br><ul>
          <li> {@code byName}: Ascending lexical order of names 
          <li> {@code byNameInverse}: Descending lexical order of names 
          <li> {@code byId}: Ascending CAN ID. Note, if an 11 and a 29 Bit frame have the
        same ID then the extended CAN ID is considered the greater one.
          <li> {@code byIdInverse}: Descending CAN ID. Note, if an 11 and a 29 Bit frame
        have the same ID then the extended CAN ID is considered the greater one.
          <li> {@code byIsExtId}: Extended 29 Bit IDs come after 11 Bit standard IDs.
          <li> {@code byIsExtIdInverse}: Extended 29 Bit IDs come before 11 Bit standard IDs.
          <li> {@code bySize}: Ascending size of payload
          <li> {@code bySizeInverse}: Descending size of payload
          <li> {@code sentFirst}: Sent frames before received frames
          <li> {@code receivedFirst}: Received frames before sent frames
        </ul><br>
          Some sort orders, e.g. sorting by size of payload, are undecided for several
        frames. A secondary, sub-ordinated sort criterion can be implemented by sorting
        twice. Begin with the sub-ordinated criterion (e.g. sorting by CAN ID) followed by
        the principal sort order (e.g. by size of payload). In this example would larger
        frames follow smaller ones and all equally sized would be ordered by ascending CAN
        ID.<p>
          Please note, once you've sorted the array of frames the initial order is lost and
        can't be restored again. This is the order of appearance in the network file.
        However, a frame iteration in this order is still possible via field {@link
        Cluster#frameInFileOrderAry}. Reordering a bus' frame list won't affect the frame
        lists owned by {@link Cluster}; {@link Cluster#frameByNameAry}, {@link
        Cluster#frameByIdAry} and {@link Cluster#frameInFileOrderAry} are constant
        throughout the complete template expansion process. */
