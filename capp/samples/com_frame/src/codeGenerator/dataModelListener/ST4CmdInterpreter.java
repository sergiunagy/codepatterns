/**
 * @file ST4CmdInterpreter.java
 * This class is a class for fields in a StringTemplate V4 data model, which behave as a
 * command interpreter. A single String argument got from the template is passed to the
 * interpreter.<p>
 *   The actual interpretation of the argument is not implemented; this class implements
 * the connection of the StringTemplate V4 engine with a listener, which will do the actual
 * command interpretation.<p>
 *   The listener is an interface only and the idea is that a data container in the
 * StringTemplate V4 data model implements this interface. Its implementation of the
 * listener can interpret the commands such that they operate on its data contents.

     * Check for presence of a given key value pair in the map.<p>

     * engine to do the actual query.<p>
     *   There's a pit-fall: The template engine has a two step approach to find the
     * map entries. First, it tries to identify the entry by passing in the template
     * attribute, which is used in the template map operator .(). The attribute is
     * represented in the StringTemplate defined Java class; different template
     * constructs will yield different Java classes. If the engine gets a negative
     * response then it tries again, this time with the attribute rendered as text, as
     * a Java String object. (If the internal attribute representation already is a
     * Java String then no second attempt is made.)<p>
     *   For us, it's impossible to operate on the internal StringTemplate classes.
     * Therefore we reject all queries with key objects, which are not of Java class
     * String and wait for the second attempt - which we always confirm.
