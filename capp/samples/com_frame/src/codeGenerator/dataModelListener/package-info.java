/**
 * Package dataModel is the set of nested classes, which form the two objects, <a
 * href="Cluster.html">Cluster</a> and <a href="Info.html">Info</a>, which are passed in to
 * the StringTemplate V4 template engine as attributes of the root template. Knowing the
 * details of these classes is essential for writing StringTemplate V4 templates for the
 * application codeGenerator of the comFramework project: The public fields and public get
 * methods of the classes described here are accessible from within the template.
