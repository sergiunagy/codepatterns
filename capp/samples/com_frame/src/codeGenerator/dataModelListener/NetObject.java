/**
 * The data structure describing the common parts of all network objects.
 *   Objects of this class are part of the nested data structure passed to the template
 * engine for rendering the information in the wanted format.<p>
 *   The basic design principle is the use of public members because such members can be
 * directly accessed from the output templates. Boolean decisions are either expressed as
 * explicit public Boolean members or by references to nested member objects, which are
 * null if an optional member is not used or applicable: StringTemplate can query public
 * Boolean members or check for null references. Convenience functions, which permit to
 * query information that can easily and on the fly be derived from the other public
 * members is implemented as Getter.

          @remark The description of an object is useless in the code generation process if
        it injects undesired characters into the generated output. If the aimed output is
        e.g., a C source file than the description must not contain non ASCII characters.
        But even more characters are unsafe: If the description is used as string literal
        in generated C source code than a backslash or double quote would invalidate the
        generated code. Other target languages prohibit the presence of line feeds, e.g.,
        GNU Octave. Therefore potentially unsafe characters are filtered out and
        replaced by a dot. If the DBC file contains natural language comments then they
        will likely be somewhat deformed in the generated output. */
