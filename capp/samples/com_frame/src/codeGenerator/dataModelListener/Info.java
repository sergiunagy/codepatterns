    /** This is a Java Map object, which can hold custom number objects. The normal

        These counters can be used to generate null based linear indexes in the generated
        code. However, special operations permit to use more general arithmetic and binary
        operations on the numbers. Furthermore, they can be compared against boundary
        values.<p>
          Please note, unlike the other fields of {@link Info} does {@code calc} not bring
        any information into the template expansion process. It's an empty scratch pad for
        some simple arithmetics on numeric value (which need to come from other elements of
        the data model). The main use case it the support of linear counters (numeric
        enumerations) in the generated code and the possibility to have conditional code on
        numeric data elements like integer message attributes.<p>
          All numbers are 64 Bit integers, all operations are 64 Bit integer operations.<p>
          The reading of a number is got by simply querying it by name in the map. All of
        the more complex operations are submitted by using pseudo map element names, which
        encode number name, operation and operand at the same time. Reading the number and
        doing the comparisons are the only operations, which affect the template expansion:
        They return a numeric or Boolean object to engine and template. All other operations
        only have their side-effect on the addressed number in the map but return null to
        the template engine - no text will be generated from those.<p>
          The pseudo element names have the pattern {@code
        <numberName>[_<operation>[_<operand>]]}. The operand either is a literal number or
        the name of an other number, which must already exist in the map.<p>
          Literal numbers are either signed decimal numbers, which may have the suffix n or
        positive hexadecimal numbers with prefix 0x or one of the Boolean constants true and
        false. The suffix n means a negation of the decimal number literal. Examples are
        12, -123, 123n or 0xffff.<p>
          The negation suffix n has been added as an alternative to the common dash for
        sake of simple template writing. Using this syntax pattern enables using the
        simpler StringTemplate V4 map access operator {@code map.key}, where {@code map}
        and {@code key} need to be identifiers. This holds for literals. If the operand is
        a signed integer attribute from the data model one will anyway have to use the more
        complex access operator {@code map.(<sub-template>)} and here the usual rendering
        of negative values with the preceding dash would be applied. (Examples below.)<p>
          The default for the optional operand depends on the operation. Most typical use
        cases are supported like linear counters and comparison with null.<p>
          The destination number of the operation should already exist in the map. If it
        doesn't it is created by side effect. The initial value depends on the operation.
        This is only possible for a few operations like set, sadd, ssub and smul and
        referencing a number for read. Except for set, linear or logarithmic counters are
        assumed.<p>
          The operations are set, get, add, sub, mul, div, sadd, ssub, smul, and, or, xor,
        not, sr, asr, sl, isGE, isLE, isG, isL, isE and isNE.<p>
          set is the assignment. Only the value is assigned; if the operand is another
        number than its possible sticky operation (see below) is not inherited.<p>
          get means reading a number. It is a unary operator and must not have an operand.
        The difference to normal reading by just stating the number's name is that a sticky
        post operation is not executed after reading. This is particular useful for
        debugging of the template code; values can be printed without altering the behavior
        of the code generation.<p>
          add, sub, mul, div are the basic numeric operations.<p>
          sadd, ssub, smul do the same as add, sub, mul but they are sticky, meaning that
        the operation is repeated every time after reading the number. This stickiness is
        how the counters are implemented. The sticky operation is cleared by applying any
        of the non sticky operations with the exception of set. Keeping the sticky
        operation for operation set further supports the use of counters as main purpose of
        the scratch pad: A counter can be adjusted to a new value but keeps counting as
        before.<p>
          and, or, xor, not, sr, asr, sl are the binary operations, the latter three mean
        shifting. Note that not is a unary operator and must not have an operand.<p>
          isGE, isLE, isG, isL, isE, isNE are the comparisons {@code >=, <=, >, <, ==, !=},
        respectively. They yield a Boolean result, which is returned to the template engine
        and which can be used in a StringTemplate V4 conditional expression. Please note,
        the Boolean result is not assigned to the destination number; all of these
        operations do not alter the map contents, they just affect the code generation.<p>
          The default operand of all comparisons is null. You can check if number x is
        negative by a simple {@code <info.calc.x_isL>}.<p>
          Examples:<p>
          {@code <info.calc.x>}: Read number x, i.e., return the numeric value to the
        template and expand it there into text. Create it as linear null based counter, if
        this should be the first reference to x. (x gets the initial value 0 and the sticky
        operation +1.)<p>
          {@code <info.calc.x_mul_23n>}: Multiply x with -23.<p>
          {@code <info.calc.y_set_0xff>}: Create y and set it to 255. No sticky operation
        is defined for y.<p>
          {@code <info.calc.y_ssub_x>}: Assign the difference y-x to y. Next reading of y
        will yield this value but subtract the same value again as internal post operation;
        subtracting x's value is the sticky operation. Note, due to the post-processing y's
        internal value always differs from the one got from reading y. Note, the sticky
        operation subtracts x's value as it was at the evaluation time of this command, not
        x's current value meanwhile.<p>
          {@code <info.calc.({noFrames_set_<cluster.noFrames>})>}: A typical way to get
        "real" numeric information into the initially empty scratch pad {@link #calc} is
        the use of the StringTemplate V4 map operator {@code .()}, which builds the key to
        the wanted value by template expansion prior to querying the map.<p>
          {@code <if(info.calc.noFrames_isG_0)>uint16 noFrames =
        <info.calc.noFrames>;<else><info.error.("No frames are defined!")><endif>}: Use of
        comparison operation to generate conditional output from a template.<p>
          Since Boolean results are not stored back into the map just like that can Boolean
        expressions be computed only with the work around of using conditional template
        code. If we express the Boolean true as -1 and false as 0 then the available binary
        operators behave like Boolean operators; this is the meaning of the Boolean literals
        true and false:<p>
          {@code <if(info.calc.x_isL_0)><info.calc.xBad_set_false><else><info.calc.xBad_set_true><endif><\\>}<p>
          {@code <if(info.calc.x_isG_100)><info.calc.xTooLarge_set_true><else><info.calc.xTooLarge_set_false><endif><\\>}<p>
          {@code <info.calc.xBad_or_xTooLarge><\\>}<p>
          {@code <if(info.calc.xBad_isNE)>#error x (<info.calc.x>) is out of range [0; 100]<endif>} */

        generation. The use case are optional constructs in the generated code, which are
        controlled from the command line.<p>
          User options/attributes can be given in the global context of the command line or

              The ST4 template expressions of all the provided string operations get only
            a single argument from the template. (It uses the map syntax, e.g., {@code

            operation.) However, string comparison requires two arguments and replacement
            operations would even require more. The concept is splitting the only argument
            provided by the template in parts and taking the parts as separate arguments of
            the aimed operation. If an operation requires n operands than the first n-1
            occurances of the delimiter split the test input into the n arguments. After
            splitting, all surrounding white space is removed from the parts, the result
