/**
 * @file NumberMap.java
 * A StringTemplate V4 support object to support (modifiable) numbers. For C code
 * generation linear counters are often useful to shape lists and enumerating sets of
 * #defines. For these, we offer a data object, which is functional by side-effect: Every
 * time it is addressed it'll have another value, particularly rising integer values.
 * Simply integer arithmetics including comparisons is also supported.
