/**
 * The Java class File already brings some valuable information about the name of a
 * file and parts of it, which is accessible from a StringTemplate V4 template - but in
 * this derived class it is even extended.<p>
 *   See <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/File.html">java.io.File</a>
 *   The practice of code generation requires some more details on file names. Here's an
 * extended class, which adds these to the Java File class in order to make this
 * information easily accessible from a StringTemplate V4 template.<p>
 *   Note, to fetch the information from the Java base class
 * <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/File.html">java.io.File</a>
 * you need to be aware of the way, the StringTemplate V4 engine accesses public methods of
 * a class: The access is restricted to public methods with names starting with "get",
 * followed by a capitalized character. The function must not have any function argument.
 * From a template, such a function is accessed without the "get" and with lower case first
 * character, see these examples:<p>
 *   - {@code <info.output.canonicalFile>} to access {@code File.getCanonicalFile()}
 * for the currently generated file<p>
 *   - {@code <info.templateFile.absoluteFile>} to access {@code File.getAbsoluteFile()}
 * for the currently applied template group file
